### Why?
Part of my project to measure performance of RNN on Context-Free Languages

### What is this?
Describtion says it all.

### How to use?
First you need create a automata file where you define your productions, start states and stuff like that.
```python
Q P F # total states
a # input word symbols
Z Y # stack symbols
Q # starting state
Z # starting stack
F # accepting states
F # E - accepts with empty stack or F - accepts with accepting state
Q a Z Q YZ # list of productions (current state, read from word, take from stack, next state, add to stack)
Q a Y Q YY
Q e Z P Z
Q e Y P Y 
P a Z P e 
P a Y P e
P e Z F e
```

**notes:**
* We agree that "e" means epsilon and will not show up as state symbol.
* You shouldn't use stack symbols that are longer than one character anything else is fine.

Thats it! Just run the script and it should ask for input file location and words to test. Have fun!

### Issues
This was a rush thing. It could really use some more edge case tests or tests in general. If any errors are found pls contact me!
